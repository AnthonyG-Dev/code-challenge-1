This repository contains a set of three code challenges written in HTML and JavaScript.

Code Challenge 1: Student Grades
The first challenge is a program that takes input from the user, which is the student's marks (between 0 and 100) and returns the corresponding grade.

Usage
To use this program, follow these steps:

Open the HTML file in your web browser
Enter the student's marks in the input field provided
Click the "Check Grade" button to get the corresponding grade
Implementation
This program is implemented using JavaScript. The checkGrade function takes the input value and checks it against the conditions to determine the student's grade. The buttonClicked function is called when the user clicks the "Check Grade" button, which takes the input value and passes it to the checkGrade function. The result is then displayed in the text area on the web page using the output and grades elements.

Code Challenge 2: Driver's Speed
The second challenge is a program that takes input from the user, which is the driver's speed, and checks if it is above or below the speed limit. If it is above the speed limit, the program calculates the demerit points and returns the result.

Usage
To use this program, follow these steps:

Open the HTML file in your web browser
Enter the driver's speed in the input field provided
Click the "Check Speed Limit" button to check the driver's speed
Implementation
This program is implemented using JavaScript. The checkSpeed function takes the input value and checks it against predefined conditions to determine if the driver is within the speed limit. If the driver is above the speed limit, the program calculates the demerit points based on the speed and returns the result. The speedButtonClicked function is called when the user clicks the "Check Speed Limit" button, which takes the input value and passes it to the checkSpeed function. The result is then displayed in the text area on the web page using the output and speedOutput elements.
